## Planning and design

### Colour palette
- In the project were used mainly three colours : Navy, White, and Gray.

The idea was taken from the Tignes [Logo](https://i.ibb.co/8dFH4b4/Tignes-Logo.png). However, I decided not to use red color in this project because I have doubts that it can make part of the project too bright and users might focus too much attention on the red segments. Additionally, Red color could be quite difficult for eyes, therefore I decided to use gray color when needed to add contrast. As it feels more calm and easier for users experience.

### Wireframes 
As to imagine the project visually, I used the Balsamiq wireframe software to build simple framework.

 Here are attached frames :
