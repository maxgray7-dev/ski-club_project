# Planning and design

### Colour palette

- In the project were used mainly four colours : Navy, White, Gray and Yellow. ![Palette](https://i.ibb.co/3MvHQVg/palette.png)

The idea was taken from the Tignes [Logo](https://i.ibb.co/8dFH4b4/Tignes-Logo.png). However, I decided not to use red color in this project because I have doubts that it can make part of the project too bright and users might focus too much attention on the red segments. Additionally, Red color could be quite difficult for eyes, therefore I decided to use grayand yellow color when needed to add contrast. As it feels more calm and easier for a user experience.

### Wireframes

For better visual support, I used the Balsamiq wireframe software to build a simple framework that would help me to imagine how this site look like.

 Below are attached wireframes :
